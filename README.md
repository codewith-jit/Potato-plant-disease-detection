# Potato-plant-disease-detection
This repository contains the source code for an end-to-end Deep Learning project designed to classify potato leaf diseases. The project moves beyond just model training to include a full-stack web and mobile application deployment. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect "Early Blight" and "Late Blight" in potato plants from images.
